ðŸ“° News Classifier - AI-Powered Fake News Detection
===================================================

News Classifier is an AI-powered fake news detection system built with Python, spaCy, 
and Scikit-learn. It classifies news articles as Fake or Real using advanced NLP embeddings 
and machine learning algorithms.



About The Project
-----------------
This project is a machine learning classifier that predicts whether a news article is 
Fake or Real. It uses spaCyâ€™s large English embeddings (en_core_web_lg) to extract 
vector representations of news text, and applies Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers for detection.  

It can be extended for real-time news verification systems or media authenticity checks.


Key Features
------------
- Fake vs Real News Detection
- Embeddings with spaCy for semantic text understanding
- Multiple ML Models: Naive Bayes & KNN
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- Scalable and easily extendable to more datasets and models


Tech Stack
----------
- Python .......... Core programming language for ML and data processing
- spaCy ........... Used for text embeddings via pre-trained NLP models (en_core_web_lg)
- Scikit-learn .... Provides ML models (Naive Bayes, KNN) and evaluation metrics
- Pandas .......... Data handling and preprocessing
- NumPy ........... Numerical operations and array manipulations
- Jupyter ......... Interactive development and testing environment
